##TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTIONS
The Titanic Survival Prediction project aims to predict passenger survival based on various attributes. Leveraging machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests, it analyzes factors like age, gender, and ticket class. The dataset is split into training and testing sets for model training and evaluation. After preprocessing, including handling missing values and feature engineering, models achieve accuracies ranging from 75% to 85%. This project provides insight into the factors influencing survival aboard the Titanic and serves as an educational resource for those interested in data analysis and predictive modeling.
##IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION
The Iris Flower Classification project aims to classify iris flowers into three species based on four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. Utilizing machine learning algorithms like K-nearest neighbors, support vector machines, and decision trees, the dataset is split into training and testing sets for model training and evaluation. Through data preprocessing, including feature scaling and encoding categorical variables, models achieve accuracies exceeding 95%. This project provides valuable insights into the application of machine learning for species classification and serves as an educational resource for those interested in data analysis and pattern recognition techniques.
##CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION
The Credit Card Fraud Detection project focuses on identifying fraudulent transactions within credit card data. Leveraging machine learning techniques such as logistic regression, random forests, and neural networks, the dataset is processed and split into training and testing sets for model development and evaluation. Feature engineering and anomaly detection methods are employed to enhance model performance in detecting fraudulent patterns. With accuracies exceeding 99%, this project showcases the effectiveness of machine learning in combating financial fraud. It serves as a valuable resource for understanding the application of data analytics in safeguarding financial systems and protecting consumers from fraudulent activities.
